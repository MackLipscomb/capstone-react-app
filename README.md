MEDCONNECT - An app designed to bring patients and healthcare professionals together in a collaborative way, in order to provide more optimized and efficient healthcare for all. Instead of going to WebMD to research generalized health information and possibly draw incorrect conclusions, patients will be able to post their symptoms or conditions to the app and correspond with a healthcare provider to get suggestions on potential treatments.
